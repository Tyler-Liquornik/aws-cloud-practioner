Architecting in AWS has some key **Best Practices**:
- **Scalability**: vertical and horizontal
- **Disposable Resources**: servers should be disposable and easily configured
- **Automation**: Serverless, IaaS, Auto Scaling
- **Loose Coupling**: Microservices, break down components into loosley coupled components so failures are isolated
- **Services, not Servers**: think of all services that can help make your life easier, not just EC2


#### The Well Architected Framework

The **Well Architected Framework**  at a high leveldictates a couple of important ideas
- Stop guessing your capacity needs, set-up auto scaling to scale based on demand
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures, design based on changing requirements
- Drive architectures using data
- Conduct game days to exercise failure scenarios, identify weaknesses, and improve resiliency

The **Well Architected Framework** has 6 pillars. We don't balance between these pillars, or have trade-offs, we aim for all of them. The pillars are:
- **Operational Excellence**: The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
	- Design Principles:
		- **Perform Operations as Code**: Use IaC
		- **Make frequent, small, reversible changes**: In case of failure you want to be able to rollback easily
		- **Refine operations procedures frequently**: And ensure that team members are familiar with it
		- **Anticipate failure**: And learn from all of them
		- **Use managed services**: Reduce operational burden
		- **Implement observability for actionable insights**: Insights include performance, reliability, cost...
	- A Stack that meets this pillar looks like:
		- **Prepare:** CloudFormation, Config
		- **Operate**: CloudFormation, Config, CLoudTrail, CLoudWatch, X-Ray
		- **Evolve**: CloudFormation, CodeBuild, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline
- **Security**: The ability to protect information, systems, and assets, while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
	- Design Principles:
		- **Implement a strong identity foundation**: Centralize privilege management and reduce (or eliminate) reliance on long-term credentials, use principle of least privilege in IAM
		- **Enable traceability**: integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action
		- **Apply security at all layers**: like edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, OS, and application
		- **Automate security best practices**: automations are more reliable
		- **Protect data in transit and data at rest**: encryption, SSL, tokenization, and access control
		- **Keep people away from data**: reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data
		- **prepare for security events**: run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recover.
	- Services that meets this pillar:
		- **Identity and Access Management**: IAM, STS, MFA Tokens, Organizations
		- **Detective Controls**: Config, CloudTrail, CloudWatch,
		- **Infrastructure Protection**: CloudFront, VPC, Shield, WAF, Inspector
		- **Data Protection**: KMS, Encryption for S3, EBS & RDS, ELB HTTPs
		- **Incident Response**: IAM, CloudFormation, CloudWatch Events
- **Reliability**: The ability to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations, or transient network issues
	- Design Principles:
		- **Test recovery procedures**: Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before
		- **Automatically recover from failure**: Anticipate and remediate failures before they occur
		- **Scale horizontally to increase system availability**: Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don't share a common point of failure
		- **Stop Guessing Capacity**: Maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over or under provisioning, use auto scaling
		- **Manage change in automation**: Use automation to make changes to infrastructure
	- Services that meets this pillar:
		- **Foundations**: IAM, VPC, Service Quotas, Trusted Advisor
		- **Change Management**: ASGs, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config
		- **Failure Management**: Backups, CloudFormation, S3 (can be glacier), Route 53
- **Performance Efficiency**: the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
	- Design Principles:
		- **Democratize advanced technologies**: Advanced technologies become services and hence you can focus more on productdevelopment
		- **Go global in minutes**: Easy deployment in multiple regions
		- **Use serverless architectures**: avoid burden of managing servers
		- **Experiment more often**: Easy to carry out comparative testing in the cloud
		- **Mechanical sympathy**: Be aware of all AWS services that can help your a problem
	- Services that meets this pillar:
		- **Performance based Selection**: ASGs, Lambda, EBS, S3, RDS
		- **Performance Review**: CloudFormation, AWS News Blog
		- **Performance Monitoring**: CloudWatch (alarms, metrics, dashboards), Lambda
		- **Performance Tradeoffs Considerations**: Example: RDS vs ElastiCache
- **Cost Optimization** the ability to run systems to delivery business value at the lowest price point possible
	- Design Principles:
		- **Adopt a consumption mode**: pay only for what you use
		- **Measure overall efficiency**: use CloudWatch to help reduce costs
		- **Stop spending money on data centre operations**: AWS does the infrastructure part and enables you to focus on projects
		- **Analyze and attribute expenditure**: Accurate identification of system usage and costs, to measure ROI. Use tags & resource groups to help with this.
		- **Use managed services to reduce the cost of ownership**: as managed services operate at cloud scale, they can offer a lower cost per transaction or service
	- Services that meets this pillar:
		- **Expenditure Awareness**: Budgets, Cost and Usage Reports, Cost Explorer, Reserved Instance Reporting
		- **Cost-Effective Resources**: Spot instances, Reserved Instances, S3 Glacier
		- **Matching supply and demand**: ASGs, Lambda
		- **Optimizing over time**: Trusted Advisor, Cost and Usage Report, AWS News Blog
- **Sustainability**: the ability to reduce environmental impacts of running cloud workloads
	- Design Principles:
		- **Understand your impact**: establish performance indicators, evaluate improvements
		- **Establish sustainability goals**: set long-term goals for each workload, model ROI
		- **Maximize Utilization**: Right size each workload to maximize energy efficiency of the underlying hardware and minimize idle resources
		- **Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings**: and design for flexibility to adopt new technologies over time
		- **Use managed services**: shared services reduce the amount of infrastructure. Managed services help automate sustainability best practices by moving infrequent accessed data to cold storage and adjusting compute capacity.
		- **Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads**: Reduce the amount of energy or resources required to use your services and reduce the need for your customers to upgrade their devices

#### The Cloud Adoption Framework

The **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** is a whitepaper that helps you build and then execute a comprehensive plan for your digital transformation through innovative use of AWS. It was created by AWS professionals by taking advantage of AWS Best Practices and lessons learned from 1000s of customers.
- CAF has 6 organizational perspectives:
	- **Business Perspective**: ensure that your cloud investments accelerate your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes
	- **People Perspective**: accelerate the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning, and where change becomes business-as-normal, with a focus on culture, organizational structure, leadership, and workforce. Cloud should serves as a bridge between technology and business.
	- **Governance Perspective**: Orchestrate cloud initiatives while maximizing organizational benefits and minimizing transformation related risks
	- **Platform Perspective**: Build an enterprise-grade, scalable, hybrid cloud platform. Modernize existing workloads, and implement new cloud-native solutions
	- **Security Perspective**: Achieve confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data and workloads
	- **Operations Perspective**: Ensure that your cloud services are delivered at a level that meets the needs of your business
- CAF has 4 transformation domains
	- **Technology**: Using the cloud to migrate and modernize legacy infrastructure, data and analytics platforms
	- **Process**: Digitize, automate, and optimize business operations
		- Use data and analytics platforms to create actionable insights

#### The Right Sizing Principle

**Right Sizing** is the idea that just because EC2 has any instance types, it doesn't mean that the most powerful instance type is the best choice as the cloud is elastic
- Matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost
- Scaling up is easy so always start small
- Look at deployed instances and identify opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements, which lowers costs
- Always right size before a cloud migration, and continuously after the cloud onboarding process since system requirements change over time
- Use services to help: CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, 3rd party services
