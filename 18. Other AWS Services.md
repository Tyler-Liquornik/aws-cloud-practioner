#### Migration & Data Movement

We can think about different cloud migration stragies in terms of **the 7Rs**
- **Retire**
	- Turn off things you don't need anymore (maybe as the result of re-architecting)
	- Helps with reducing the surface areas for attacks (more security)
	- Save on costs for the retired resources/services
- **Retain**
	- Do nothing for now (still counts as a decision to make regarding cloud migration)
	- May want to keep on-prem for security, data compliance, performance
	- There might just not be business value in mirgating or its too compliacted
- **Relocate**
	- Move apps from on-prem cloud-native (containerized system) to to cloud version at the infrastructure/VM level
	- Move EC2 instances to a different VPC, account, or region
- **Rehost (lift & shift)**
	- No cloud optimizations being done, migrate app as is
	- Migrate machines into the AWS Cloud
	- Example: migrate using AWS Migration Service
- **Replatform (lift & reshape)**
	- Not changing core architecture, but leverage some cloud optimizations
	- Save time and money by moving to a fully managed service or serverless
	- Example: migrate your DB to RDS, migrate your app to Elastic Beanstalk
- **Repurchase (drop & shop)**
	- Moving to a different product while moving to the cloud
	- Often you move to a SaaS platform
	- Expensive in the short term but quick to deploy
	- Examples: CRM to Salesforce, HR to Workday
- **Refactor/Re-architect**
	- Reimagining how the app is architected using cloud native features
	- Driven by the business need to add features and improve scalability, performance, security, agility
	- Often means moving from a monolith to microservices

**AWS DataSync** helps with moving large amounts of data from on-prem to AWS
- Synchronizes with S3 (any storage class), EFS, and FSx for Windows
- You can schedule replication tasks hourly, daily, or weekly
- Replication tasks are incremental after the first full load
- Works through the DataSync agent installed on-prem

**AWS Application Discovery Service** allows you to plan migration projects by gathering information about on-prem data centres. 
- Important data collected includes server utilization data and dependency mappings
- Discovery has 2 different ways it can work
	- Agentless Discovery with AWS Agentless Discovery Connector provides VM inventory, configuration, performance history (CPU, RAM, I/O)
	- Agent-based Discovery with AWS Application Discovery Agent gives you more information, including more details for configuration, system performance, inforamtion on running process, and details of network connections between systems
- Resulting data can be viewed in AWS Migration Hub

**AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) (formerly AWS CloudEndure Migration)** executes a rehosting (lift & shift) migration. 
- Converts physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers to run natively on AWS
- Continuous block-level replication of servers
	- An AWS Replication Agent is installed on-prem executes the replication continuously into a staging environment in AWS to keep costs low. When you're ready, cutover to the production AWS cloud environment.

**AWS Migration Evaluator** helps you build a data-drive business case for migration to AWS
- Provides a clear baseline of what your business is running today
- Install agentless collector to conduct broad-based-discovery
- Take a snapshot of on-prem footprint, server dependencies, etc.
- Analyze current state, define target state, then develop a migration plan

**AWS Migration Hub** is a central location to collect servers and application inventory data for the assessment, planning, and tracking of migrations to AWS.
- Helps accelerate your migration, can automate lift-and-shift
- AWS Migration Hub Orchestrator provides pre-built templates to save time and effort in migrating enterprise apps (e.g., SAP, SQL Server, ...)
- Supports migrations status updates from Application Migration Service (MGN) and Database Migration Service (DMS)
#### Backups & Disaster Recovery

**AWS Backup** is a fully managed service to centrally manage and automate backups across AWS Services
- ON-demand and scheduled backups
- Supports Point-in-time Recovery (PITR)
- Retention Periods, Lifecycle Management, Backup Policies...
- Cross-Region Backups
- Cross-Account Backups using AWS Organizations

**AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) (formerly CloudEndure Disaster Recovery)** is a quick and easy way to recover your physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers into AWS.
- Example: protect your most critical databases (including Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server), enterprise apps (SAP), protect data from ransomware attacks
- Different disaster recover strategies:
	- Backup and Restore: Backup on-prem data to the cloud (S3) and recover in case of disaster from the cloud
	- Pilot Light: Core components are running in the cloud with a light setup, the rest is on-prem. In case of disaster on-prem you can quickly scale up from what's already in teh cloud
	- Warm Standby: Same as pilot light, but a full version of the app is in the cloud, but at minimum size.
	- Multi-Site / Hot-Site: A full version of the app at full size is in the cloud
- Continuous block-level replication of servers
	- An AWS Replication Agent is installed on-prem executes the replication continously into a staging environment in AWS to keep costs low. When disaster strikes on-prem, failover from staging to production

**AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)** is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS Workloads.
- Based on the idea of **chaos engineering**, which means stressing an application by creating disruptive events (e.g., sudden increase in CPU or RAM usage), and then observing how the system responds and implementing improvements
- Helps you uncover hidden bugs and performance bottlenecks before disaster strikes
- Use pre-built templates that generate the desires disruptions
- Supports EC2, ECS, EKS, RDS, and more
